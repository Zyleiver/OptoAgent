# Previous Experiment: Blue Perovskite Stability

We found that adding 5% Cesium (Cs) to the FA-based perovskite significantly improved the thermal stability at 85°C. However, the phase segregation issue remains under illumination.

Key finding: Cs-doping helps formatted stability but exacerbates light-induced phase segregation in mixed-halide compositions (Br > 20%).
