        "description": "Develop a new device structure integrating our proprietary passivation layer with the high-mobility transport layer described in the literature.",
        "reasoning": "1. Analyzed 2 new papers and 0 internal experiments.\n2. Identified a gap: Current experiments focus on stability, but Paper A suggests a new material for efficiency.\n3. Hypothesis: Combining our encapsulation technique (Experiment 1) with the material from Paper A could improve both.\n4. Feasibility Check: We have the equipment for encapsulation. Material A is commercially available.\n5. Conclusion: Propose a new experiment series.",
