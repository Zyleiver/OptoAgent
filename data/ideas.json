        "description": "This project proposes investigating the impact of engineered interfaces between wide-bandgap perovskite layers and narrow-bandgap colloidal quantum dots to achieve panchromatic light absorption and efficient charge transfer, aiming for higher efficiency and potentially improved stability in next-generation solar cells.",
        "reasoning": "1.  **Identify key trends and gaps from the papers:** The provided paper descriptions, despite lacking full content, strongly emphasize the \"exceptional energy-harvesting efficiency\" and \"high efficiency\" of perovskite materials in solar cell applications. This indicates a primary research trend around understanding and leveraging perovskite's outstanding optoelectronic properties. A key gap, even for highly efficient materials, is often their spectral utilization (e.g., inability to absorb across the full solar spectrum efficiently) and long-term stability. While perovskites are efficient, their bandgap often limits infrared absorption, and interfaces can be points of instability and recombination.\n2.  **Find connections with internal experiments (if any):** No internal experiments are recorded yet, allowing for a foundational research direction.\n3.  **Propose a specific, actionable experiment:** The proposed experiment is to design, fabricate, and characterize hybrid optoelectronic devices that integrate wide-bandgap perovskite layers (e.g., custom-composition perovskites tuned for blue/green absorption) with narrow-bandgap colloidal quantum dots (CQDs, e.g., PbS or InAs QDs tailored for red/infrared absorption). The core novelty lies in systematically engineering the interface between these two materials. This could involve exploring different surface ligands on the QDs, applying ultrathin interlayer materials, or optimizing perovskite surface passivation techniques to facilitate efficient charge transfer, reduce interfacial recombination, and potentially enhance the overall device stability. The performance metrics would include power conversion efficiency (PCE), external quantum efficiency (EQE) across a broad spectrum, and transient spectroscopic studies to elucidate charge dynamics at the interface.\n4.  **Assess feasibility:** Both perovskite and colloidal quantum dot synthesis are well-established in the literature and can be performed in a typical optoelectronics lab. Device fabrication (spin-coating, thermal evaporation) and characterization techniques (J-V curves, EQE, UV-Vis, PL, TRPL, transient absorption spectroscopy) are standard tools. The combination of these two promising materials with a focus on interface engineering offers a tractable path to explore enhanced broadband light harvesting and improved charge extraction, building upon the \"exceptional efficiency\" of perovskites.",
